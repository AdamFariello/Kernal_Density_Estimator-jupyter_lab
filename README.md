# Introduction
This repository is from the 4th lab assignment "Kernel Density Estimator", 
from: 

["Rutgers 198:439 'Introduction to Data Science'" (Click here to see the class page)]("https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/course-synopses/course-details/01-198-439-introduction-to-data-science").

The course was taken during Fall 2022, taught by Professor Gunawardane.

# Description 
This notebook does the following:

1. Takes sample data (the data is a survey of the performance of various countries)

2. Imports the data into a pandas dataframe

3. Then over time goes through these steps in various orders:

    - Import data

	- Clean data

	- Alter data 

	- Present data (using print(), or graphing library(s))

# How to setup the repository
## Download the repository 
Clone the library using git clone

## Downloading required libraries:
Libraries used:

- ipywidgets

Each can be installed via the terminal with: `pip install [insert library]`

## Program to run the lab
Any program that runs jupyter labs. 

I personally use the linux mint repository release.

(
Which can be installed through the terminal with: 
`Sudo apt-get install jupyter`
)

# Running it
After opening it, 
just scroll through to see the graphs created by the code blocks.

You can run all the code blocks, or run each one by one, 
to double check the code.

For any other usage, 
I recommend reading 
[a tutorial such as this one](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/)
