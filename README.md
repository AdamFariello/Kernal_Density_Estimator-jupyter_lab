# Introduction
This repository is the work from, and for, 
the cs439 lab: *"Kernel Density Estimator"*.    
[The course](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/course-synopses/course-details/01-198-439-introduction-to-data-science) 
was taken during Fall 2022

---

# Description 
The notebook imports a .json of sample data.    
Then the following actions, (without any order, nor equal amount of times), are *taken:

- Clean data   
- Reformat/Alter the data   
- Make new dataframes and series from that data       
- Present data 
(using print, show(), or graphing library(s) such as seaborn)   

**The steps above were done without a particular order, nor equal amount of times*
